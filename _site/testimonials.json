[{"authorName":"Christa H.","body":"I just moved in to a new home with no security system and inadequate Wi-Fi. Caleb's maturity, analytical approach, and great questions he was able to really customize a perfect set up for me in one weekend- that was fast! I went from nothing to everything in 2 days of very hard work. He is extremely industrious, will get the job done with skill and great communication. I am extremely impressed and have an incredible set up with a system known as Unifi. He mounted a rack system and set up a firewall just for starters. He got me on the app and I can see everything from my phone!! Wowza. Definitely give Caleb a call for any IT needs, Computer set up (he also did for me); and installation of network systems. Thank you Carlson Solutions!","ratingValue":5},{"authorName":"Delaine R.","body":"Caleb has been to my home twice now. He presents himself very well. He has a very pleasing personality and I immediately felt comfortable with him! This is a young man of high integrity. He is very mature, knowledgeable and gifted in his field of expertise. He knows what he's talking about as his hands fly over the computer key board. Most went over my head but he typed up extremely understandable \"Dee structions\"! I refer to them as needed! As an older single lady with no family close, the help Caleb offers through his company is priceless! I am very thankful for his help and kindness. He's definitely on my call back list when the need arises. I will be verbally advertising for him and handing out his business card!","ratingValue":5},{"authorName":"Norm B.","body":"Carlson Solutions updated my entire business system and I am so pleased.
